## NucleusHover
NucleusHover is a Nucleus addon that adds hoverable placeholder extensions. It also supports suggesting commands, running commands on click, parsing PlaceholderAPI placeholders and other nucleus extensions in the text, and etc. 

### Using
There's a config file that has a list of placeholders. You can make new ones based on the default placeholder in the config. The Nucleus extension is {{nh_[name]}}, where name is the name of the placeholder on your config.

This plugin also adds a %meta_[key]% placeholder for PlaceholderAPI. It returns the LuckPerms' meta value associated with that key. Example uses are meta_prefix, meta_suffix, etc.
